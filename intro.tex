\chapter{Motivation}

\section{Catching Problems Early} 

Years ago, I worked on a proprietary low-power processor in an embedded
system. The processor ran a microcode featuring a custom instruction set. To
enter a low-power state, a set (possibly hundreds) of instructions were
executed. These instructions progressively put the system in a lower power state.
For example: Turn off IP A, then turn off IP B, then turn off the power island
to the IPs. To save cost and power, the low-power processor had very limited
debuggability support.\\

An experienced reader may start to notice some red flags.\\

If the microcode attempts to access the memory interface when the power
island has been shut off, the processor will hang. Since the debug power island has
been shut off, the physical hardware debug port is also unavailable, leaving the
developer with \textit{no way} of live debugging problems. At this point,
the developer needs to search through numerous instructions to
catch system constraint violations (invariants) \textit{manually}.\\

As one can imagine, maintaining the microcode was very expensive.
Fortunately, the proprietary low-power processor only had a handful of
instructions, so I created a simulator for this proprietary processor to verify
the microcode before deploying it on-target. The simulator models the processor
states as a state graph, with executed instruction, transitions the state machine
to the next state. At every state, all the invariants are verified. Example
invariants include:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Accessing memory interface after power off leads to a hang 
    \item Accessing certain register in certain chip revision leads to a hang 
    \item Verify IPs are shut off in the allowed order
\end{itemize}
The verification algorithm was implemented using a \textit{depth-first-search},
providing 100\% microcode coverage before deployment on target.\\

In reality, any system can be modeled as an arbitrary set of states with a
collection of invariants that be true at all times. The complexity of such an
arbitrary system generally grows quadratically as the number of states grows
linearly (eg. in an N-state system, adding state N+1 may introduce N
transitions into the new state). There are many engineering problems with a
large number of states, such as lockless or wait-free data structures,
distributed algorithms, OS schedulers, consensus protocols, and more. As the
number of states grows, the problem becomes more challenging for designers to
reason about.\\

So, how do we produce a system that is \textit{correct by design?} 

\section{The Generalized Problem}

Fast forward to now: I stumbled across TLA+, a formalized solution of what I
was looking for.\\

In the age of big data, vertical scaling is no longer practical. The industry
has been exploring and implementing horizontal scaling solutions for past two
decades. Instead of focusing on increasing clock speed, hardwares vendor has
been focusing on adding more instances of hardware in their design. On the
other hand, software vendors has been designing horizontal scaling solution that
takes advantage of large volume of commodity hardware. There is one slight
problem: Horizontal scaling requires concurrent reasoning, and:\\

\textit{Humans are not good at concurrent reasoning}.\\

Our cognitive system is optimized for sequential reasoning. Enumerating
all scenarios in one's mind to ensure an arbitrary design accommodates all
the corner cases is challenging.\\

Consider a distributed system. The system is a cluster of independently
operating entities, which collectively needs to offer the correct system
behavior. At any given time, nodes in the cluster may receive instructions
out-of-order, crash, recover, etc.\\

Consider a single producer multiple consumer lockless queue. The consumers may
reserve an index in the queue in a certain order but may release it in a
different order. What if one reader is slow, and another reader is superfast
and possibly lapses the slow reader?\\

Consider an OS scheduler with locks. Assume all the processes have the same
priority. Can a process starve the other processes by repeatedly acquiring and
releasing the lock? How do we ensure scheduling is fair?\\

The \textit{anti-pattern} is to keep band-aiding the design until the user stops
filing bug reports. This is never ideal. Per Murphy's law, anything that can go
wrong \textit{will go wrong}, and a hard-to-reproduce bug will come in at the
most inconvenient time. How do we make sure the solution is \textit{correct by
design}? To solve this problem, we must rely on tools to do the reasoning
\textit{for us}.

\section{What is TLA+?}

TLA+ is a \textit{system specification language} to describe a system
without implementation details. TLA+ allows a designer to describe a system as a
set of states with transitions from one state to the next. Designers can
describe invariants that must hold in every state and liveness properties a
sequence of states must satisfy. One of TLA+'s keys is once the system is modeled
as a finite set of states, the states can be \textit{exhaustively} explored
(via breath-first-search) to ensure properties are upheld throughout the entire
state space (either per state or a sequence of states).

\section{About This Book}
This book was initially a set of notes I took while learning TLA+. I decided to
formalize these notes into this short book, which I hope the readers will find
helpful in their TLA+ journey.\newline

The book intends to teach the reader how to write TLA+ specification for their
design to provide confidence in its \textit{correctness}. This book is targeted
to software designers, hardware designers, system architects, and in general
anyone interested in designing correct systems.\newline 

To get the most out of the book, the reader should have general computer science
knowledge. The reader doesn't need to be an expert in a particular language to
understand this book; TLA+ is effectively its own language. This book is
example-driven and will go through designs such as lockless queues, simple task
schedulers, consensus algorithms, etc. Readers will likely enjoy a deeper
insight if there is familiarity with these topics.

\section{How to Use This Book}

This book was designed to be used as a reference, providing examples
and references using TLA+.\\

This book is split into multiple parts, covering TLA+ native notation, PlusCal
(C-like syntax that transpiles down to TLA+ native notation), and rapid
prototyping with TLA+. All examples will follow a similar layout, covering the
problem statement, design, spec, and safety properties.\\

All examples in this book will be presented using TLA+ \textit{mathematical
notation}. Converting between Mathematical and ASCII notation is assumed trivial
due to the one-to-one mapping. Readers are encouraged to consult Table 8 in
\cite{ss} as needed.\\

The last part of the book provides language references and some focused topics.
Readers can use it as general reference.
