\chapter{TLA+ Primer}

\section{Purpose}

The key insight to TLA+ is modeling a system as a state machine. A simple
digital clock can be represented by two variables, hour and minute and the
number of possible states in a digital clock is $24 * 60 = 1440$. For example,
a clock in state 10:00 will transition to state 10:01. Asssume an arbitrarily
system described by N variables, each variable having K possible values such
arbitrary system can have up to $N^K$ state.\newline

For every specification, designer can specify \textit{safety} proerty (or
invariants) that must be true in \textit{every} states. For example, in any
state of the digital clock hour \textit{must} be between 0 to 23, or formally
described as $hour \in 0..23$. Similarly, minute must have value between 0 to
59, or $minute \in 0..59$. Examples invariants of a system include: Only one
thread has exclusive access to a critical region, all variables in the system
are within allowable value, resource allocation manager never allocates more
than available resources.\newline

Designer can also specify \textit{liveness} property. These are properties to be
satisfied by a \textit{sequence of state}. One liveness property for the digital
clock could be when the clock is 10:00, it will eventually become 11:00 (10:00
\textit{leads} to 11:00). Example liveness property include: a distributed
system eventually converges, the scheduler eventually schedules every tasks in
the task queue, the resource allocation manager fairly allocates resources.
\newline

A TLA+ Spec can be checked by TLC, the model checker. TLC uses
\textit{breath-first search} algorithm to explore \textit{all} states in the
state machine and ensure safety and liveness properties are upheld.\newline

A TLA+ Spec describes the system using \textit{temporal logic}. The syntax may 
appear unfamiliar if one hasn't seen it before, but like any other programming 
language an initiated reader should become familiarized quickly. In this book I
will use 

\section{Design}

In this example, we will specify a \textit{digital clock}. The digital clock has
a few simple requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two variables to represent state: hour and minute
    \item The clock increment one minute at a time
    \item Hour is between 0 to 23, inclusive
    \item Minute is between 0 to 59, inclusive
    \item Clock wraps around at midnight (ie. 23:59 transitions to 00:00)
\end{itemize}

\section{Spec}

The \textit{Init} state of such system can be described as: \newline
\begin{tla}
    vars == <<hour, minute>>
    Init ==
        /\ hour = 0
        /\ minute = 0
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Init \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{=} 0}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{=} 0}%
\end{tlatex}
 \newline

$\defeq$ is the \textit{defines equal} symbol and $\land$ is the \textit{logical
and} symbol. The above TLA+ syntax can be read as \textit{Init} state is defined
as both hour and minute are both 0.\newline

The spec also always include a \textit{Next} definition, an \textit{action
formula} describing how the system transition from one state to another. Action
formula contains \textit{primed} variables what happens to the variable in its
next state. The \textit{Next} action for the digital clock can be defined
as:\newline

\begin{tla}
    NextHour ==
        /\ minute = 59 
        /\ hour' = (hour + 1) % 24
        /\ minute' = 0
    NextMinute == 
        /\ minute # 59
        /\ hour' = hour 
        /\ minute' = minute + 1 
    Next ==
        \/ NextMinute
        \/ NextHour
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} NextHour \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{=} 59}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{'} \.{=} ( hour \.{+} 1 ) \.{\%} 24}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{'} \.{=} 0}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} NextMinute \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{\neq} 59}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{'} \.{=} hour}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{'} \.{=} minute \.{+} 1}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} Next \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} NextMinute}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} NextHour}%
\end{tlatex}
 \newline

Here's a breakdown of what the spec does:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Next} can take either \textit{NextHour} or \textit{NextMinute}
    \item \textit{Next} takes \textit{NextMinute} when \textit{minute} is not
    59. \textit{NextMinute} doesn't update \textit{Hour} and increments \textit{Minute}.
    \item \textit{Next} takes \textit{NextHour} when \textit{minute} is 59.
    \textit{NextHour} increments \textit{hour} modulus 24 and sets \textit{minute} to 0.
\end{itemize}

Note that the formulas are \textit{state descriptions}, not \textit{assignment}.
\textit{minute = 59} describes the state transition takes when minute
\textit{equals} 59. Since this is an equality description, \textit{minute = 59}
and \textit{59 = minute} are equivalent in TLA+.\newline

Finally, the Spec itself is formally defined as:\newline
\begin{tla}
    Spec ==
        /\ Init
        /\ [][Next]_vars
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} vars\@s{0.63} \.{\defeq} {\langle} hour ,\, minute {\rangle}}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} Spec \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} Init}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\Box} [ Next ]_{ vars}}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

Note this forms the basis for \textbf{all} TLA+ Spec. Every example in this book
will include a Spec definition similar to this. \newline

$\Box[Next]_{vars}$ deserves some special attention:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $vars$ is defined earlier to be \textit{all} variables in the spec, in
    this case hour and minute. Combination of these variables at different
    values constitute the states of the system (eg. 23:59 and 00:00 are differente
    states in the system).
    \item $\Box[Next]_{vars}$ is a box-action formula, where \textit{Next} is an
    action and \textit{vars} is a state function.
    \item $\Box$ operator asserts the formula is always true for every step in the behaviour.
    \item And steps in the behaviour is defined as $[Next]_{vars}$, where $Next$
    describe the action and $vars$ capturing all variables representing the state.
\end{itemize}

This can be roughly translate to: the system is valid for for every step
\textit{Next} can take, forming the basis of the Spec.

\section{Safety}

Safety property describes invariant that must hold true in \textit{every} state
of system. A common invariant is \textit{type safety} checks. In a digital
clock, hour can only be in value between 0 to 23, and minute can only be value
of 0 to 59:\newline

\begin{tla}
    Type_OK == 
        /\ hour \in 0..23
        /\ minute \in 0..59
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Type\_OK \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{\in} 0 \.{\dotdot} 23}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{\in} 0 \.{\dotdot} 59}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

When hour or minute falls outside of the specified range, the model checker 
reports failure.

\section{Liveness}

Liveness property verifies certain behavioural across a sequence of state. One
liveness property is to confirm the clock wraps around at midnight, a property
that can only be verified after checking at least two states: \newline

\begin{tla}
    Liveness ==
        /\ hour = 23 /\ minute = 59 ~> hour = 0 /\ minute = 0
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Liveness \.{\defeq}}%
 \@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{=} 23 \.{\land} minute \.{=} 59 \.{\leadsto}
 hour \.{=} 0 \.{\land} minute \.{=} 0}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

$\leadsto$ is the \textit{leads to} operator, suggesting something is eventually
true. TLA+ provides a set of operators to describe liveness property.\newline 

To verify liveness, we need to modify the spec slightly to enable
\textit{fairness} to prevent \textit{stuttering}. In plain terms, fairness
ensure a state always transition to \textit{some other state}. Without fairness
the spec is allowed to \textit{stutter}, or \textit{not transition} to any state. 
This by definition fails liveness property check as the model checker is
unable to verify the behaviour across a sequence of states. To get a more 
comprehensive description of fairness, refer to the last part of the
book.\newline

\begin{tla}
    Spec ==
        /\ Init
        /\ [][Next]_vars
        /\ WF_vars(Next)
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Spec \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} Init}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\Box} [ Next ]_{ vars}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\WF}_{ vars} ( Next )}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

$WF_{vars}(Next)$ is the fairness qualifier.

\section{Model Checker}

The TLA+ spec can be verified using TLC model checker. The model checker runs
the spec and verifies all configured safety and liveness properties are
satisfied. In short, the model checker a library written in Java, and can be
invoked using command line java. For instruction on installing the model checker
and related tools, please see \cite{toolbox}.\newline

After installing the model checker, we need two things to verify the spec:
\begin{itemize}
    \item clock.tla: spec 
    \item clock.cfg: config file
\end{itemize}

For reference, clock.tla is listed below:\newline

\begin{tla}

    /\ hour \in 0..23

Init ==
    /\ hour = 0
    /\ minute = 0
NextMinute ==
    /\ minute = 59 
    /\ hour' = (hour + 1) % 24
    /\ minute' = 0

    /\ minute # 59
    /\ hour' = hour 
    /\ minute' = minute + 1

The corresponding clock.cfg is listed below: 
\begin{framed}

\end{framed}

After putting both clock.cfg and clock.tla in the same directory, one can now
run the model checker. In this book I'll assume a commandline interface for the
model checker:
\begin{verbatim}
java -cp /usr/local/lib/tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC clock
...
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.8E-17
1441 states generated, 1440 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 1440.
\end{verbatim}
The 1440 states in the graph represents total number of minutes in a day.
