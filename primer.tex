\chapter{TLA+ Primer}

\section{Design Intent}

The key insight into TLA+ is modelling a system as a state machine. A simple
digital clock can be represented by two variables, hour and minute and the
number of possible states in a digital clock is $24 * 60 = 1440$.  For example,
10:01 is the next state 10:00 can transition to. Extrapolating further, Asssume
an arbitrarily system described by N variables, each variable having K possible
values such arbitrary system can have up to $N^K$ state.\newline

For every specification, designer can specify \textit{safety} proerty (or
invariants) that must be true in \textit{every} states. For example, in any
state of the digital clock hour \textit{must} be between 0 to 23, or formally
described as $hour \in 0..23$. Similarly, minute must have value between 0 to
59, or $minute \in 0..59$. Examples invariants of a system include: Only one
thread has exclusive access to a critical region, all variables in the system
are within allowable value, resource allocation manager never allocates more
than available resources.\newline

Designer can also specify \textit{liveness} property. These are properties to be
satisfied by a \textit{sequence of state}. One liveness property for the digital
clock could be when the clock is $10:00$, it will eventually become $11:00$
(\textit{$10:00$ leads to $11:00$}). Example liveness property include: a
distributed system eventually converges, the scheduler eventually schedules
every tasks in the task queue, the resource allocation manager fairly allocates
resources. \newline

A TLA+ Spec can be checked by TLC, the model checker. TLC uses
\textit{breath-first search} algorithm to explore \textit{all} states in the
state machine and ensure safety and liveness properties are upheld.\newline

A TLA+ Spec describes the system using \textit{temporal logic}. The syntax may 
appear unfamiliar if one hasn't seen it before, but like any other programming 
language an initiated reader should become familiarized quickly. In this book I
will use 

\section{Requirement}

In this example, we will specify a \textit{digital clock}. The digital clock has
a few simple requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two variables to represent state: hour and minute
    \item The clock increment one minute at a time
    \item The clock wraps around at midnight (ie. 23:59 transitions to 00:00)
\end{itemize}

\section{Spec}

The \textit{Init} state of such system can be described as: \newline
\begin{tla}
    Init ==
        /\ hour = 0
        /\ minute = 0
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Init \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{=} 0}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{=} 0}%
\end{tlatex}
 \newline

$\defeq$ is the \textit{defines equal} symbol and $\land$ is the \textit{logical
and} symbol. The above TLA+ syntax can be read as \textit{Init} state is defined
as both hour and minute are both 0.\newline

The spec also always include a $Next$ definition, an \textit{action formula}
describing how the system transition from one state to another. Action formula
contains \textit{primed} variables what happens to the variable in its next
state. The $Next$ action for the digital clock can be defined as:\newline

\begin{tla}
    NextHour ==
        /\ minute = 59 
        /\ hour' = (hour + 1) % 24
        /\ minute' = 0
    NextMinute == 
        /\ minute # 59
        /\ hour' = hour 
        /\ minute' = minute + 1 
    Next ==
        \/ NextMinute
        \/ NextHour
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} NextHour \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{=} 59}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{'} \.{=} ( hour \.{+} 1 ) \.{\%} 24}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{'} \.{=} 0}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} NextMinute \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{\neq} 59}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{'} \.{=} hour}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{'} \.{=} minute \.{+} 1}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} Next \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} NextMinute}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\lor} NextHour}%
\end{tlatex}
 \newline

Here's a breakdown of what the spec does:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Next$ can take $NextMinute$ or $NextHour$
    \item $Next$ takes $NextMinute$ when $minute$ is not 59, next hour is hour, next minute is minute + 1. 
    \item $Next$ takes $NextHour$ when $minute$ is 59, next hour is (hour + 1) modulus 24, next minute set to 0
\end{itemize}

Technically it's possible for $Next$ to take both $NextMinute$ and $NextHour$.
This is not possible in this definition as $NextHour$ and $NextMinute$ are
defined in a \textit{mutually exlusively} fashion.\newline

Finally, the spec itself is formally defined as:\newline
\begin{tla}
    vars == <<hour, minute>>
    Spec ==
        /\ Init
        /\ [][Next]_vars
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} vars\@s{0.63} \.{\defeq} {\langle} hour ,\, minute {\rangle}}%
\@x{\@s{16.4} Spec \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} Init}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\Box} [ Next ]_{ vars}}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

$\Box[Next]_{vars}$ deserves some special attention:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $vars$ is defined to be \textit{all} variables in the spec. Different
    combination of these variables constitute the states of the system (eg.
    23:59 and 00:00 are both states in the system).
    \item $\Box[Next]_{vars}$ is a \textit{box-action formula}, where
    \textit{Next} is an action and \textit{vars} is a state function.
    \item $\Box$ operator asserts the formula is always true for every step in the behaviour.
    \item And steps in the behaviour is defined as $[Next]_{vars}$, where $Next$
    describe the action and $vars$ capturing all variables representing the state.
\end{itemize}

%  $,  The formula is true iff every
% successive pair of steps in behaviour is a $[Next]_{vars}$. Finally $Spec$ is
% conjunction between $Init$ and $\Box[Next]_{vars}$. Note \textbf{all} TLA+
% specification follows very similar template. There are situation we will need to
% provide \textit{fairness} description - this will be covered later. \newline

\section{Safety}

Safety property describes invariant that must hold true in every state of
system. A common invariant is \textit{type safety} checks. In a digital clock, 
hour can only be in value between 0 to 23, and minute can only be value of 0 to 59:\newline

\begin{tla}
    Type_OK == 
        /\ hour \in 0..23
        /\ minute \in 0..59
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Type\_OK \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{\in} 0 \.{\dotdot} 23}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} minute \.{\in} 0 \.{\dotdot} 59}%
\end{tlatex}

\section{Liveness}

Liveness property verifies certain behavioural across a sequence of state. One
liveness property can be confirming the clock wraps around correctly at
midnight (which involves mutliple states): \newline

\begin{tla}
    Liveness ==
        /\ hour = 23 /\ minute = 59 ~> hour = 0 /\ minute = 0
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Liveness \.{\defeq}}%
 \@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} hour \.{=} 23 \.{\land} minute \.{=} 59 \.{\leadsto}
 hour \.{=} 0 \.{\land} minute \.{=} 0}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

$\leadsto$ is the \textit{leads to} operator, suggesting something is eventually
true. TLA+ provides a set of formulas that can be used to describe liveness
property.\newline 

To verify liveness, we need to modify the spec slightly to enable
\textit{fairness} to prevent \textit{stuttering}. In plain terms, fairness
ensure \textit{something} always happen in every step, allowing the states to
transition. Without fairness the spec is allowed to \textit{do nothing} as next
step, this means liveness condition may fail because the spec permits the system
to do nothing in perpetuity as next state. Fairness will be covered in more
detailed in later chapter.\newline

\begin{tla}
    Spec ==
        /\ Init
        /\ [][Next]_vars
        /\ WF_vars(Next)
\end{tla}
\begin{tlatex}
\@x{\@s{16.4} Spec \.{\defeq}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} Init}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\Box} [ Next ]_{ vars}}%
\@x{\@s{32.8} \.{\land} {\WF}_{ vars} ( Next )}%
\end{tlatex}
\newline

$WF_{vars}(Next)$ is the fairness qualifier.

\section{Model Checker}

The TLA+ spec can be verified using TLC model checker. The TLC model checker
runs the spec and verifies all configured safety and liveness properties are
satisfied during execution. To run TLC, we need two things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item clock.tla - the spec itself
    \item clock.cfg - the corresponding configuration file
\end{itemize}

For reference, clock.tla spec is listed below:

\begin{tla}

    /\ hour' = (hour + 1) % 24

The corresponding clock.cfg is listed below: 
\begin{lstlisting}
    SPECIFICATION Spec

    PROPERTIES Liveness
\end{lstlisting}

Now run TLC and one should see something like this: 
\begin{lstlisting}
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
...
The depth of the complete state graph search is 1440.
